# Brad-Traversy-Bootstrap-Course
Brad Traversy's Bootstrap 4 course

In this project I code along with Brad Traversy through his course on Bootstrap 4.
He goes through the Basics first and then goes on to create 5 responsive websites using mostly Bootstrap 4.
He's very fast, I had to stop the videos so many time to catch up with him.
Hope you'll like the projects.
